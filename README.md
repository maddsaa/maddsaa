Hello world,

I am analytical thinker, experienced in developing digital transformation solutions. 
Problem solver and thirsty detail seeker! I am strongly interested to enrich my knowledge in Spring framework, Hibernate and overall backend development.

Recently, I started to develop business solutions in approach of test driven development (TDD). 
I've worked in developing systems integrations and migrations. As well as some participation in developing then releasing upgrades for legacy systems. 
I worked either individually or with agile teams.
